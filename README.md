# @flux0-ai/react

_@flux0-ai/react_ makes it effortless to build **interactive AI applications** in React by streaming real-time responses from a [flux0](https://github.com/flux0-ai/flux0) server using **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**. It removes the complexity of handling streaming updates, making it easy to integrate **large language model (LLM) interactions** into your app without worrying about state loss or inefficient polling.

## Why Use This?

- **Effortless LLM Integration** â€“ Easily connect React components to an LLM-powered backend, enabling real-time AI-driven conversations, assistants, or creative tools.
- **Instant Streaming Updates** â€“ Get AI responses as they generate, without waiting for full messages to complete.
- **Handles Navigation & State** â€“ Ensures streaming persists across pages when needed, avoiding session resets on route changes.
- **Flexible API** â€“ Choose between **React Context** for persistent state across routes or a standalone **useSSE** hook for isolated streaming.
- **Lightweight & Scalable** â€“ No need for WebSockets or polling; SSE pushes updates efficiently with minimal overhead.

## Perfect for Building

âœ… **AI chatbots** with real-time responses
âœ… **Storytelling platforms** with dynamic AI-generated content
âœ… **LLM-powered assistants** that interactively process user input
âœ… **Live dashboards & monitoring tools** with continuous updates

With **@flux0-ai/react**, you can build rich, interactive AI applications in React with just a few lines of code. ðŸš€
